            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that allows users to have access to a file and make changes to it while also saving each version of that file. This allows users to revert back to the file in any of its previous states and allows users to see who has edited the file last. version control systems aid in comparing the new files to the old versions and also when and what was specifically changed about the file. Ultimately this system is commonly used by web designers and solves the problem of file sharing letting many people take advantage of version control systems.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is free and open to anyone. Its accessibility does not compromise with its capacity to preform quickly and efficiently. It out preforms many other version control systems with its ability to provide multiple workflows and local branching for less. Git allows every user to have full access to files stored locally on their own computer instead of trying to reach a server, making it faster then others. Git does not store its data like other VCSs, it takes snapshots of files each time the file is committed so that each version is automatically saved and safely stored., this is key when file sharing.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a repository that is shared by multiple people working on a file.  It is accessed through a remote server where files can be pulled and pushed from each person’s individual computer. This allows many people to work on the same file at the same time. This can be used in the work place or when multiple people are working on the design or graphics of a file. This cuts out having to email the file back and forth or all work on the same computer. Remote repositories save time and improve efficiency in many work fields not just design. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository that is locally stored on your computer, saving your files directly to you instead of retrieving them from a source. Although it is possible to push your files to a remote repository, a local one saves time. This is more useful when working on a time consuming project individually. There are two ways to create a local repository on your own computer. One way is to create a whole new repository. Another way is to clone an already existing repository in a remote location onto your own computer. Either way a local repository creates a save source for your files while improving efficiency. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands are statements that instruct your computer on how to store your files on your computer using git. They can be used in an integrated development environment as code to tell your computer commands. Some common git commands are, git init tells your computer to create a new local repository where you can save and access files on your personal computer. Git add . tells your computer to add all files and folders to your directory. Git commit –m ‘Commit message’ tells your computer to save the changes to your file and commit then to the local repository. There are many other git commands allowing you to access remote repositories and many other actions used in version control systems. </p>
